<p>I also love to play saxophone, I started learning the saxophone in the year 2018 there about, I'm not really sure. When I started playing the saxophone, it was a little hard. First thing I told my saxophonist was that my fingers were short</p>
<p>because my fingers were not reaching the last tomb bell, it was difficult for me to blow just the mouth piece because saxophone have a special way of placing your mouth, my lips and lower pallet really hurt after playing and also my neck hurts after long play.</p>
<p>But right now, it's just a story, a love everything about it and I have become better, I am trusting God for my personal saxophone</p>
